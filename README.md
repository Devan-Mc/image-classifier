# image-classifier
This was my final project in Artificial inteligence. The Project4.ipynb is a google colab file and can be opened using google colab. There was a few seperate files for the interface, but I did not work on those files and no longer have access to them. I did make this neural network and you can test it out by running it on google colab. If you want to test different images you have to change the img_path near the bottom before running it.
